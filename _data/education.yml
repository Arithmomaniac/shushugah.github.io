# Degree
- uni: Flatiron School
  year: April 2014 &mdash; September 2014
  summary: I was one of thirty applicants to receive a full ride scholarship for the Flatiron Web Development Bootcamp (New York City). All code submissions were completed with Git/GitHub workflow. The final two months we spent working on our own projects. I worked on a New York Subway [text alerts app](http://nycsubwayalerts.herokuapp.com/) and revamped website of [Code2040](http://www.code2040.org/).
